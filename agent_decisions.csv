SEC delays Bitcoin ETF approval again.,BTC dropped 3% with high volume,BTC,"SELL

The news of the SEC delaying a Bitcoin ETF approval, coupled with a 3% drop in BTC price with high volume, suggests a negative market sentiment.  High volume during a price drop indicates significant selling pressure. This is a bearish signal, making selling a prudent option to limit potential further losses."
"Ethereum crosses $3,000 with strong DeFi activity.",ETH up 5% in 24h,ETH,"BUY

Reasoning:  The news and market signal are both positive.  Ethereum crossing $3000 and experiencing strong DeFi activity suggests strong underlying demand and bullish momentum.  A 5% increase in 24 hours further reinforces this upward trend.  While there's always risk in any investment, the current indicators suggest a favorable opportunity for buying ETH.  However, this is not financial advice, and individual risk tolerance should be considered."
Major crypto exchange faces liquidity crisis.,"BTC price flat, low volume",BTC,"HOLD

The news of a major crypto exchange facing a liquidity crisis is negative for the market.  However, the market signal of a flat BTC price with low volume suggests that the market is currently indecisive and not reacting strongly to the news.  This could mean several things:  the news is not considered as significant as initially feared, the market is waiting for more information, or buyers and sellers are equally hesitant.  In this situation, rushing into a buy or sell decision based on limited information would be risky.  Holding allows the trader to observe how the market reacts and gather more information before making a potentially costly move."
Ethereum gas fees surge due to NFT minting.,ETH down 1.2% in 12h,ETH,"SELL

The news indicates high Ethereum gas fees due to NFT minting.  While this might suggest some activity and demand within the Ethereum ecosystem, the market is already reacting negatively with ETH down 1.2% in 12 hours. This suggests that the negative impact of high gas fees (making transactions more expensive and potentially deterring users) is outweighing any positive sentiment from NFT activity.  Therefore, selling would be a prudent strategy to avoid further potential losses."
